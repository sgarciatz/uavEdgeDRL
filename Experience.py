    An Experience is a data structure that holds the following

    Attributes:
    - state: is the current state of the env.
    - action: the action taken in the current env.
    - reward: the reward associated to taking said action in the
      current environment.
    - next_state: the resulting state after applying the action.
    - done: a flag that states if a state is terminal.
    - priority: a numerical value used for prioritized memory 
      replay. Is a measurement of the importance of the experience.
